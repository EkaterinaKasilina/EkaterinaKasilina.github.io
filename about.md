I am a senior data scientist with more than 10 years of experience 
in applying machine learning, data analysis, and deep learning to solve real-world problems. 
I currently work at EPAM Systems, a global leader in digital platform engineering and software 
development services, where I take part in multiple projects across different domains and industries.
